# Jenkins on AWS ECS with Terraform Documentation

This documentation provides a detailed overview of the Jenkins master-slave architecture deployed on AWS ECS using Terraform. It covers the core concepts, implementation details, and internal mechanisms.

## Acknowledgements

This implementation is heavily inspired by and adapted from the excellent work by Tom Gregory, specifically his guide on [Deploying Jenkins into AWS ECS](https://tomgregory.com/jenkins/deploy-jenkins-into-aws-ecs/#launching-the-cloudformation-stack-in-your-aws-account). We extend our sincere gratitude for his valuable insights and foundational work.
